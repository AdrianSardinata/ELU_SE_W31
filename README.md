Instructions:
In this assignment, you will work on improving the quality of a provided codebase through static analysis and code review. The main objective is to identify and address code quality issues, potential bugs, and adherence to coding standards using a static analysis tool. You will document the issues you discover and describe how you fixed them.

Codebase:
You can find a simple Python codebase that calculates and displays the total price of items in a shopping cart on this repository: https://github.com/shoklah/ELU_SE_W31. The codebase consists of a single Python script named `shopping_cart.py`. However, this script contains several issues related to code quality, potential bugs, and adherence to coding standards.

Tasks:

1. Static Analysis:
   - Choose a Python static analysis tool (e.g., `pylint`, `flake8`, `bandit`).
   - Run the chosen tool on the `shopping_cart.py` script to identify and document code quality issues, potential bugs, and deviations from coding standards.

2. Issue Resolution:
   - Fix the issues identified by the static analysis tool in the codebase.
   - Commit your changes with meaningful commit messages describing each fix.

3. Code Review:
   - Review the fixed code to ensure that the identified issues have been adequately addressed.
   - If you find any additional issues during your review, repeat the process of fixing and committing.

Submission Guidelines:

1. Fork the provided GitHub repository and clone it to your local machine.
2. Choose and run a static analysis tool on the `shopping_cart.py` script.
3. Fix the identified issues.
4. Commit your changes with clear commit messages.
5. If needed, repeat the issue resolution process after your review.
6. Provide the link to your public forked repository with the fixed code.
